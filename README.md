# Revamp

It's not just `gitRevamp`. I used this to revamp a couple of things:

- Git & GitHub: Branching, Forking, Commits, PRs, Workflows; amongst others
- HTML + CSS + JS Projects: 
  - [Animaland](https://codehokage1.github.io/gitRevamp/revampFE/animaland)
  - [Accordion](https://codehokage1.github.io/gitRevamp/revampFE/accordion)
